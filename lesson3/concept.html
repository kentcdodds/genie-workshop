  Genie can give you a list of intelligently organized wishes which are in context for a given <code>magicWord</code>
  based on a priority calculated by a <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/genie#about-matching-priority">sorting algorithm</a>:
  <ol>
    <li>In order of most recently executed (makeWish) with the given magic word</li>
    <li>If the given magic word is equal to any magic words of a wish</li>
    <li>If the given magic word is the start to any magic word of a wish (i.e. 'he' in 'hello');</li>
    <li>If the given magic word is the start to any word in a magic word (i.e. 'wo' in 'hello world');</li>
    <li>If the given magic word is contained in any magic words of a wish</li>
    <li>If the given magic word is an acronym of any magic words of a wish</li>
    <li>If the given magic word matches the order of characters in any magic words of a wish.</li>
  </ol>
  <div>
    The first priority in the list is where genie learns the user as it is used. As wishes are made with a specific magic
    word, it becomes the "King of the Hill" for that magic word. If another wish is made with the same magic word, then
    it becomes "On Deck." If this on deck wish is made with that same magic word it will then become "King of the Hill"
    and the previous king becomes on deck.
  </div>
  <div>
    Also, if a wish is made with "wish" and then you attempt to get the matching wishes for "wi" then that wish will
    come up as a priority wish because genie sees that "wish" begins with "wi" to be a little more intelligent.
