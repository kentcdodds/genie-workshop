  This is the initial setup for the Genie-Workshop. Here are a few things of interest before you begin:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Even though this workshop uses AngularJS, <code>genie</code> itself has <em>no</em> dependencies.
      However, <code>ux-genie</code> <em>is</em> an AngularJS module and therefore depends on AngularJS.
    </li>
    <li>
      The only stuff you really need to concern yourself with for the workshop are the seconds of code that
      exist in between the commented lines.
    </li>
    <li>The section above will show you what concept you're learning, its branch, and the next concept/branch.
      When you're finished with this section, just execute that git command.</li>
    <li>This section will contain information about the concept.</li>
    <li>The section below will illustrate the concept.</li>
  </ul>
  The process to setup your project to use <code>genie</code> is pretty simple.
  Simply insert a <code>script</code> tag before your <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
  tag with the source to your genie file. Like so:
  <pre>&lt;script src="/vendor/genie.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  <small>*If you're using ux-genie, you'll want to do the same with ux-genie,
    except make sure you include it before you load your own module.</small>

  <div>
    To make sure everything's working currently, try <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to reveal genie's lamp.<br />
    Don't concern yourself about genie's lamp now. We'll go over that a little later. For now, just go ahead to the next section.
